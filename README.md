#  Dessert List

This was an iOS Coding Challenge for a potential job search. The instructions were to write a native iOS app to allow users to browse recipes using the [API at TheMealDB](https://themealdb.om/api.php). The app was to access two endpoints:

* https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.
* https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID.

The user needed to be shown the list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted aphabetically.

When the user selected a meal, they needed to be taken to a detail view that includes

* Meal name
* Instructions
* Ingredients/measurements

Other coding guidelines were as follows:

* Asynchronous code must be written using Swift Concurrency (async/await).
* Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.
* UI/UX design is not what youâ€™re being evaluated on, but the app should be user friendly and should take basic app design principles into account.
* The project should compile using the latest version of Xcode.
